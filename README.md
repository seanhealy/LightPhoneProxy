# LightPhoneProxy

A Simple SMS and iMessage Proxy for the Light Phone 2.

## Getting Started

LightPhoneProxy requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed.

You can either start it from the terminal with `npm start` or by double clicking `Launcher`.

> **Note:** If you are using the Launcher you must [grant _Full Disk Access_ to Terminal](http://osxdaily.com/2018/10/09/fix-operation-not-permitted-terminal-error-macos/). This is required in order to subscribe to messages.

LightPhoneProxy also currently requires a Twilio account with a _proxy_ number for each contact you wish to converse with setup in `config.json`. There is no reason why many people couldn't share these proxy numbers so I'm planning on figuring that restriction out as with more people using it the phone number cost per user would be lower.

## Contributing

Please open an issue if you have any ideas. I'd like to get this to the point where it could be a simple application.
